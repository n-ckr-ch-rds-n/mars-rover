# Mars Rover

Many thanks to Thoughtworks for giving me the opportunity to attempt this tech test.
To run the app, first make sure you have npm and Node.js 
[installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm), then run `npm install` in this repo to 
install the dependencies, followed by `npm run start`. The `npm run test` command will run the tests.

## Approach
- I decided to write my solution in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), a superset of JavaScript that allows 
developers to add static types to their JavaScript code.
- I used the Test-Driven Development technique to build the app, writing my tests with the [mocha](https://mochajs.org/)
 framework and [chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) assertion library.
- To make things simpler I adopted the [ts-mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-mocha) wrapper, which allows 
developers to run TypeScript tests (via [ts-node](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node)) without the need for a 
compilation step.
- I have endeavoured to embody Object-Oriented Programming best practices in my code, beginning by developing the Rover 
class and creating new classes and interfaces as and when the single responsibility principle seemed to dictate it.
- The rules allow you to use any mechanism for feeding input into your solution. I decided to implement a basic command
 line interface using the Node.js [readline](https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html) API, which I extended slightly in 
 order to use async/await syntax.
- I have tried to follow the principles of clean code, and to make my code self-documenting (except in the case of the
 readline extension, which I thought justified a comment).
